Binary Search in a List

Description:

This Python script implements a binary search algorithm in a randomly generated list. The user is prompted to enter the size of the list and the number to search for. The script then generates a list of random integers, sorts it, and performs a binary search to determine if the specified number is present.

How to Use:

    Run the Script:
        Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

    Enter List Size:
        Input the size of the list.

    Generated List:
        The script creates a list of random integers.

    Enter Number to Search:
        Input the number you want to search for in the list.

    Search Result:
        The script performs a binary search and indicates whether the number is present or not.

Important Notes:

    The generated list is sorted before applying the binary search algorithm.
    The script handles situations where the specified number is not in the list.

This script is a basic implementation for educational purposes. Feel free to modify and enhance it based on your needs.
